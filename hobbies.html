         <p>I usually spend my leisure time doing gym. I also like to watch movies and TV Shows and my favourite genres include suspense, horror, action, and comedy. 
            Also being a nature lover, I love to travel a lot to different places. I love to drive bikes and cars and try new foods of different cultures.
         So A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is an indoor location for athletics. The word is derived from the ancient Greek term "gymnasium".
         They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "fitness centre", which is often an area for indoor recreation.
         Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, 
         and can be one way or round trip.[1] Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.
         A movie or film is a type of visual art that uses images and sounds to tell stories or teach people something. Most people watch movies to entertain themselves or to have fun. Some movies can make people laugh, but other movies can make them cry, or make them feel afraid.</p>
